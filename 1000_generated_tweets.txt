====================
Thanks for the 32-0 @MVG_Mew2King thx so much
====================
LOL. This is simply too weird.
====================
Looks like @b1rdborn at Duke has atleast 8 players in the NA Mega Genesis field, where @MVG_Mew2King can qualify for pools... would be crazy to have top 3s in the entire world so soon
====================
Tbh, I think that the high recovery time from shield stuns would make my combo game even better, tho I think throwing will just be slightly better in future builds.
====================
I also love ÊäÄ„Åã„Çä„ÅÑ I understand it. I understand this decision
====================
I didn‚Äôt expect more than 500k concurrent viewers but I am happy about that and i am also VERY sad to see the troll stopped, I will be a better man for having support ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüî´

====================
Whether I like it or not is going to be a real question for the fans of Riot..   To make any changes at all at any game, you need a plan B  Seems like most recently, Riot only allowed for the addition of map features, I never expected them to allow for possible tweaks to the chat or of course buffs to the super cool things   Not a surprise to hear this from the industry who are supposed to be THE gatekeepers of the MOAB block  #revenge
====================
Thank you @TeamSecretGaming for a lot of fun for us to watch on Tuesday night. It was an exciting atmosphere for sure
====================
Now I know why not to have diet coke at a tournament  @GROUTISAOW  Also winning players these days   @Papink_Shroomed you are a disappointment

I hate how critics misquote important information sometimes
====================
Results so far on a 6 week vacation with the USA, not much to report, all the highs were at 4 am, and lots of lows (3-2 vs FC Dallas in a NALCS game) (work to fix more offstream issues). Will take time getting used to new settings/day or less random gameplay moments, but happy for @R6Tixes to give it a shot =D

Following BOTH of these streams, I finally started playing ultimate again after many years of switching.  No other sport has been as exciting/helpful to me as ultimate has helped me grow as a person.  Feeling good about the progress so far, hopefully I can maintain this pace and stay healthy for the long run.
====================
What will our own improvement feel like at this MLG Atlanta event? It's last player standing finals.  Just tuning in after ESL 7 lan aaaa

So I finally found a decent sleep schedule that I can match the free nights. @TSMZeRo
====================
All fantasy [Crisis] games worth playing (given the chance). Gonna try my very best tonight @ECG_Mobile

We are top 8 in the league but the EU doesnt want to win, we have our upsets so i'm not surprised! 
====================
G G H I I K
====================
Added : don't wait at cpus, twitter is behind. You need to catch up with the top ranks.    I said streamify overrewatch anyway cause a gif + youtube link already popped up from newcomenow. So do me a favor and click the button below. Good Luck
====================
comint hard w/ new patch:  my mind is fucked, but my heart is as strong as ever, so I'm able to enjoy the game even more and play better than I did before! lol
====================
All games got broken except @_@ and 0-1 in the semi final. We still have the game in front of us, what an honor.
====================
Wish I had the coinflip skill. I wanted to keep throwing the coinflip for bigger rewards (and it couldnt)
====================
EDG TY !
====================
that second last hit combo dude
====================
Made some pretty 'feeling' pixels for @TOO_GAY_HOST . The fountain isn't a big deal to him or anybody else but we have to watch your back

====================
Adding the ability to enable/disable twitch emotes = not cool   Anyone who argues or claims to be unaware   Thank you
====================
This game feels WAY too much like people need a trainer but then stand over, watching as thousands of mice arrive. This game's @$SELFIE
====================
Grand finals 4 minutes of gold for overtime ! Just like the Dallas Overwatch World Cup tomornd. Thanks for all the hosts &lt;3
====================
3-0 vs 100T in the DH Austin closed qualifier.  First a game.  GGs @TeamDignitas - for letting me win, last 1 game against dust2. Need to take our pressure game to the g2 side.
====================
To be super clear, MY dude @FdyNNy is not what you are looking for. HISTORY POINT IS HIM. Let that sink in.
====================
Man it is Dangly depressing when you think about it. Everyone has to win that game 1 vs 1 for a take one wick
====================
<|startoftext|>fuck you still haven't given me a reason to rage at it
====================
Since I can't look at it from another angle, and I got all F-bombs and spacies booked, people were worried (and looking for it) and I was probably feeling a lot of my emotions.
====================
Hi guys

====================
o.o @G2SPUNRIER we lost 1-2. We'll fuck it up by surviving another month of play.
====================
Obviously losing to Fireteam late on isn't because i wasn't fighting, I just felt too vulnerable on the other team and couldn't win due to terrible drafting, got bailed out tho!
====================
i know i always wanted to win but like the game always changing you have to learn from it, always
====================
Mark my words, Google+ will dominate the travel industry once again with Daydream VR.

Really really good endgame but not 1 lucky   100-1 possible fucks to white players on us humans    (by far) a more even-featured finish than today but they will continue battling until they die. Was fun.

====================
Is the New Smashy team destroying our seeds?!
====================
I had never said on stream before this, and that was hard to swallow and swallow hard. I'll be honest i don't wanna continue as my old self as well, I want to keep living the life i had before. Wish me luck fans! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
====================
When your CF is worth 2-5 Million Per Backbone, that's pretty impressive just think about it, going from 1 hour break between lobbies to 22,5 seconds and the game could be TERRIBLE imo.
====================
GREETINGS! Everytim is real high and seems like the #1 burning concern and needs to give a 1PM ammount to fix the tie. So i gonna keep this thread to distribute and hopefully i can let them know what i learned  time and time again ill be giving out codes to "take home" 200 LP RLC albums
====================
Thats the end of it man, he got sent packing. :)

Wooo one of the worst streams i have ever seen

This game is INSANE. GGWP CHI LIMBS!
====================
As someone who's fond of say a million ears whenever I listen to a certain track, one of the things that bothered me so much about people who arent like me that rely solely on being able to talk to or hear me gets the most of me in this day and age. People who don‚Äôt understand how much people appreciate good art, people who are so obsessed by "the dream" and "what people want" and don't give a flying f'k what they wanna hear/try to hear, people who see every situation as if they exist in another reality, how can you ever change/improve? You can become better if you try. And I'm not saying I condone it but I try to find the best in anyone.
====================
TLG vs Flying_Spartan x 3 was a good match... almost forced map 2, GGWP to 2-1 in a very tight game

====================
So I used a Telefang to stunmed and shot my Master Yi in their 16 hp blue ward and at 00:40 fountain lane we had no blue ward and no counter tower and the enemy lost 3 turrets and 17 tower and only 5 first level cs lol

Yesterday at @Hack1S @ESEA Summit, @theprinceofssbm played over 17k waves of waves to win.  Wave 1 was 3 laps to the stadium, and 2 laps into the dome. Wave 2 was 20 mins, then 19 mins, and then 20 mins.  Wave 3 was 20min then 15min, then 20 minutes, then 20 minutes, then 22 mins, and then 22 minutes.

Three streams in two days! #TeamLiquid
====================
SKT Bo5 Finals show!
====================
I think last two stream VODs were "objectionable" I think that means there was nothing wrong with the replay, there was only an issue in the timestamps on some of the angles...
====================
Pardon everything, I missed @Team_Shadow_6 in this tourney. The @Virtus_Pro_Esports team has been incredible in all the matches I played today, very nice to have you on my team again : )

====================
Original photo of me showing my title in the canteen  Also went by the nickname "TheReflector"! No one was mad!!
====================
I used to think shulk was trash, now he's Gimmicky.
====================
The upside is that i‚Äôm always improving (even tho i got off game very early).  The downside is that im not good enough to be taken seriously in a live environment. But with that as a backdrop I‚Äôm confident
====================
I wish i was seeded 6th so I could lose a massive $70k dollars tournament.
====================
So excited! I had a little bit of Overwatch back when I was younger, just gotta remember to use bots all the time 
====================

====================
We faced @NineInchNr in Grand Finals  Based on that's not a bad matchup haha @GameOverZeissss @KnightMaldoR ! We face Diggity in the Bo5 later tonight. Something special =/   Let's go @Clearlovegaming
====================
Someone give me air! I‚Äôve had to take a break for the past 4 days from playing mid due to not feeling 100% mentally and I‚Äôm gonna take a break for a few days after that.  Maybe play more games solo and just chill in my room.  Just the two of us! I wish you had something like this!
====================
I said you're retarded but I'm NOT done with you, you're so fake now...
====================
Alexa, what kind of gas does this ???? LOL
====================
Went in last man it was a 33-17 and I lost.   Got a load of 3v1 punishes on myself and didnt go full team.  I will keep it one step more powerful. GGWP A2 it's just 13-10 if @ArmadaUGS and @GameGymRox like the zSS looker

====================
‚ÄãI know that if I stream, I will inevitably get some negative comments, but the fact that there are so many people getting mad in the lead up to a match means we must maintain our standards -- I hope we can have an exciting and successful ESL stream
====================
Hey guys in Taipei and Korea! My friends @ChuDatMaLz @RealWkXD @jakehb1t0 @mvgleague

Oh come to find out... I dropped out of semia for the University of Missouri-Kansas City and get my MBA. Also don't know why I haven't bought a ticket yet, or I've been unable to log in. Kinda hate to set you up but it's gonna be a long night
====================
I'll be getting some new friends tonight 
====================
Stopped eating. I'll probably skip this matchup unless you get a double early. Money isnt an issue in this one.
====================
This is coming from someone who has never won an FPL game before, their Korean opponent was knocked out of the tournament 0-2.
====================
was looking for @TeamSheltie_EU CSAM with a three down in the playoff / offline bracket at @G2esports  unfunny
====================
I currently feel like my voice isn't as consistent or as off as i thought i was. People saying i didnt expect this, well i did hope I was pretty bad for a midas run!!!
====================
Rough shits for giving an honest answer for no loss. No doubt it's worse than yesterday's for sure but at least we broke 100 subs.
====================
16-1 @TSM_Leffen @Secret_Xp . 12-0 vs @TSM_MacD ! A lot better than pre season but we still have a long way to go. Super happy to be there for him. #TSMWIN

There is a freaking gene blow here in North Las Vegas with an extremely dangerous status! It seems to only affect twin 1 things (male and female), however, it affects ANYTHING! Something must be done to stop this mutation, we need you to help us find an answer ASAP =D
====================
Okay everyone before I come out to cut AEST, will be in 40-50 min, I'll take it. My recording of matchup was rewound because some bugs were introduced into finals and ended up on vod so it's been edited. Let's see if we can maintain it until apex

This game is crazy, super comfortable but a little dizzy with the terrain, üêî
====================
Played this mostly solo tbh!
====================
Project LMAO
====================
I think everyone knows this so it'snt much of an issue
====================
So a user called Matt cut his line in the middle of the night while the updater was downloading, and all the screens went black, as seen in all the screenshots of the stream
====================
Overall feel for @LFGISE this time around is interesting! I appreciate it immensely.  Idk why i wanna do it though im not as strong as yesterday :( We have our moments when we need to be playing, but ultimately I think that: We still play on which side we can play them  Big stage their style is weird to me  What's on in the major?  I want it better LOL

====================
Today i reak 3 hours of sleep, will do a short 5-hour stream after scrimm, when:  Sunday 30th June @ 1pm Central / 10am UTC  Things to consider for resuming: 1) online MMR of players 2) latency of servers = 2x as fast (lack of players vs ping in games) as before
====================
Mad props to @LiquidHbox
====================
Policies change frequently, updates on some are real quickly.
====================
Fun stream, been playing a lot lately, will try to continue from where I left off. #1 late night ranked stream in the world, don't know who else does it but me, idk..

====================
Goes way to bad from @HoneyBeeCMNDR though

You can do lots of stupid things as the last wildcard and get lucky in the end. Seriously.
====================
With Highlander, I hope we can end the season in a 3-0 vein and drop the series off. We came close to the championship earlier this year and deserve it more this time.
====================

====================
It‚Äôs so sad to hear about a match like this but I hope the *real* Muffin can hold his composure and bounce back after going down in a losing streak. It‚Äôs so frustrating when I see people complain about it afterwards because I understand their frustration, I'm just glad to see them realize it from their teammates and spectators, I hope this encourages other teams too =)
====================
Today was a humbling one for me as an athlete/man. Just because I have brown skin doesn't mean I am a super hero.
====================
Broken arena is such a fun game. Not on platform, but still a nice=

====================
Getting hit by a Nalcplas if you don't run backwards is a bad idea. Just a suggestion to at least try and use an attack with a timer as such that doesnt put me in risk of getting hit by the nalcaps instead.
====================
Even though I'm probably not gonna be traveling as much as I used to be I'll still try and do a full internet stream for some KI

Summer was the best. It was completely different than the season 1 i expected, there's a lot of fun stories, and jokes throughout the battle and rival queues. Now for going back to university.
====================
been wayyy too picky on watching official videos since the dev came back, going to start at 730 am Pacific ( 19 hours from now ) and go as often as possible. streams will start at 7am pacific :)

In Korea his start even seems worse than usual
====================
Gladiators forfeited tomorrow but they were the better team so ggwp. Can't change the mood, loss sucks.
====================
Happy with the change. I'm less prone to exaggeration, as if I haven't got better by now, it's more like I'm falling apart as a person on an occasional basis.
====================
It wasn't @broken_ray19 's fault but my own.  When I was getting matched with people they gave my tag but they forgot to give my dm.  Showed me. #JohnMcD
====================
"..come on lol" is the best thing I've said about Blackladievah during a competition    v xD
====================
Being @r6taknor when theres one on 1 is like 4 months without me performing, might as well stop caring and stop being so modest.   After 15 days of facing you ill be back and in my strat. Sorry for this criticism.
====================
I've taken the time to train for like half a month and I'm so much stronger than I was yesterday haha! I need to strengthen my combos even more now that I have so many people here ‚ù§

====================
Not sure what I'm doing today. Here I go my objective shift is almost over.
====================

====================
Looks like as best a duck player/champion as @UGS_Android can get
====================
I hear the trolls coming back. You cannot fake them. You are well aware. Understand?
====================
Imagine having like ~500k followers but usually only view a few per day lol
====================
Another meltdown, finally another 1-2 hr of sleep
====================
I now use an asterisk ( | # in # ) as a toggle to delete all editor changes, even if it was a one click by accident. It really helps to know what it does.
====================
Would have lost but our defense so flashed in these eagles games. GGWP all
====================
let's see if we can bring the "harry potter" crowd in and potentially get some games
====================
Won the IRONMAN and hosted by @ArbySoft ace @sryper_tweek, a very emotional day for sure
====================
GO GO @AIRPLANEH2K
====================
Seems very funny playing like a faggot   Fuck nip
====================
On a side note, after doing "personal optimization" with one of my past stream, I realized how inaccurate the concept is, but the payoff is so huge.  Thank you so much for all the support, see you tomorrow at 10am PST! &lt;3
====================

I don't mean to sound impolite, but the first question i asked is gonna haunt me forever for the rest of my life :P
====================
The temple gave me permission to use the supershield for my matches, I need to start using it more often before I lose matches.

====================
I want them to do a tweet out to say how exciting it is for us to finally have official NHL fashion coverage! Be on the lookout for us at our next @CapcomTakeover event from 5th and Market! I'll also get to @PlayOverwatch
====================
I'm going to be watching it online at the same time, but I'll be on my way to Vegas instead so the stream could be a tad delayed üôè
====================
So im not sure if my gifter csmash is legit... my mind trying to think up new ideas lol
====================
Thanks @RGBridetplc  You're officially the only team i've played with since the B2.6 update to win two games in a row.
====================
I said "oceans 8 days, a little bit closer to 6 days, more than half the time max" I started it off and half the time it was just ticking back like nothing. Why is this?
====================
Couldn't even go and be there    3oooo many bums at the festival today   Check out the tapbook after the match is over
====================
I'm really into kradyne, that bush on Ahri makes him really fun to play.
====================
There was a lull for like 3 days where we didn't have to fight against shit, the last two victories were some other TPP teams! Sorry guys, they came back stronger today. 4G and 900's on my phone =w=
====================
Alright @JetCofR

Thank you for helping make the memories that will last a lifetime, I will miss you in such a way...
====================
As many of you may know I‚Äôve recently been doing OBS, but not everything works properly - Video playback and voice work out with OC still need to be resumed &amp; sound/video arent working (ipad 6)
====================
As it got more and more popular, Bethesda had to nerf some pretty terrible loading screens.
====================
You're going to really enjoy
====================
I hate you guys
====================
Not sure if I want to play again. I don't know if I can. Hopefully we can get some game 1 this time.
====================
Most boner inducing game at an LTC right there

====================
Got through customs in the UK, got a package today from Denmark, Packing my r2 badge in my luggage now ;-; - getting Sweden through the lines at least for now :( Gotta sleep in, sleep in
====================
I don‚Äôt feel this way about either my teammates, or myself, but unfortunately I also need to take a break after a while because of high push and pressure situations that I get all sorts of disconnects. I want to try and cool down and just focus at my new thingy
====================
Random Caught Still doesn't sound horrible 
====================
Do I need a mate to kill a mountain lion? Lol.
====================
We are the only teams that can win a game 8 in three games like we did today, and win the fnatic game. A lot to work on for this season. We will get it. We are not fazed by destiny.
====================
Major to win a tourney is more important than Kix losing on stage  Thanks for all the fun games  #SuperBowl
====================
Sorry :(  I always wanted to practice martial arts but i dont wanna fight anyone i know though that likes to fight  Couldn't use much of the information rn

====================
forgot my wallet and cards!
====================
I got off my flight to Philly today at 10:30am.  There was a dispute on the plane, someone decided to ask if I wanted to borrow the check.  Unbelievable.. world class customer service and good old "satisfaction"=)
====================
Looks like I got defeated by IG as well. Loss does nothing, nothing!
====================
If you wanna go, that will be great cause Im gonna sit in the playoffs bracket and let you guys know how happy and sad I am cause I want you guys to see some of the pain I put you through.
====================
I <|startoftext|>I could easily lose an entire season with 6 sets in a row.
====================
oif i dont take a pass from me tonight i got a msg saying there is no trickery this time as the online CS awards panel vs my sis
====================

Noticed another @teamassassins and @LTVIan when I was 4-4 again and got 2-0d with a bad Abathur nexus and had to ban it on purpose. Ah well.
====================
you feel youre not good enough  show ur self more of that so i dont know what to think lmfaooo
====================
I got  Rivals avi
====================
Kade is honestly the single best Zafina I've ever played with #TSMWIN
====================
Samsung needs to figure out how to play with each other in game with both junglers as well as with mid for the best of use.  If Samsung cant find a way to play this good this split, this season is almost over.  Meanwhile, LG has not really been working out hard to begin with, so they are at an all-time disadvantage.
====================
As someone who doesn't even play actual melee, there's no way this character is winnable i think idk where i stand on it.
====================
Honestly haha. Hope to see you guys again at Summit. Great player for sure. I hope you all enjoyed the game &lt;3
====================

HotS as a music video? Shit
====================
As a 100k player and 21 year old from Switzerland who speaks 3 languages I gotta say I never expected to play S1 every day in the long run, did you? New game though, this one is good tho
====================

On today's game we played most of the maps with our offense and defense, unfortunately it was going to be a close game but we win nonetheless.  I miss EU and their aggression, and the genji wolf >_<<
====================
Waste is my 10th seed for this tournament, never made it to losers   :(
====================
like when nakkiel gets a strats he's actually only playing against balance lines so it takes me 10sec to even notice.

====================
I love getting interviews to ask you questions like this:  Something you can do about seeing ghosts has been suggested to me, but it's not feasible to do it by switching platforms (in melee)  I have a great feeling about this, because I have used it countless times in the past, in my PvP battles as well, because I can always see a ghost on either side, and then react to it easily.

Greatie, the first week of LCS, it's a great mindset and yes I know that some people would want this take more seriously, but it's important to remember that most casual players don't even know how far behind the ladder this team is when going up against the best teams in the world
====================
Couldnt unpack this bag '0&gt;p'
====================
still dont have the points I needed (until well below par) in Apex (events, my freq was weaker than normal) It depends how low and higher my freq is, however when I switch I know it will be from ranked/battles. IT HAS TO BE LEFT ALREADY.
====================
Mirage wasn't that much worse than RoR tho   Longer DSj range and some dude behind left waved like he was going to play the hell out of the game or something.  I was fine not caring though.
====================
going to Canada in a few days, i still think cold means ??
====================
dont take these finals seriously; i have no passion for CS as it is.
====================
CCC rumors are real right now and we're sure to be banned from any future matches!  Can't wait to play you tomorrow! #G2CLG
====================
Holo is kind of like E. I'm really proud of the team that was able to pull it off in their group.  Thank you so much for watching! We gonna take these!"
====================
try an old stream and check my other vods (todays one coming tomorrow)=)
====================
I have been using the update for a couple of days, yesterday was out of this world. Thank you and I hope you give it a follow so I don't have to play lol
====================
Still the best team in the world and super proud of you all, woulda been time in SP but not for us just yet
====================
If possible get ready to DQ @GB
====================
I was insane at summit   My move is pathetic, I will be heart break
====================
That point I wasnt talking about, it's the very nature of game itself that makes
====================
2016 is the year of special instruments, specially techknight sna
====================

====================
One of the saddest things to hear when watching an opponent come back to the game a 2v2 vs an exposed ultimate player is that the protoss lost the game. I don't know what was happening in the match, I feel absolutely horrible when I see so many replays of losses to an exposed player
====================

====================
Sorry if this isn't standard 2.0 final game but I really wanted to show my passion for Halo in a non-hype environment and I think I did my part.  I really appreciate all the love and support! I'll try to get all the tournament practice and feedback and stay healthy through this crappy break from melee

Let's do this... switching between kings and kings get a lot harder than people are letting on. Yes, I know this was a small modification that will benefit every player, but I also want to clarify that we made this change not for fun, but to reflect the overwhelming community feedback regarding this matter. The feedback is being completely fair, I only wanted to make a change so that I can continue to respond to community feedback &amp; to the existing pro scene standards, for everyone.

hi guys, stranger on   JUST A FEW DAYS,   BRING HI BODY MAN
====================
If i dont wanna do it anymore and i feel so awful and ashamed...can i just chill idk what i am supposed to say? I just feel like I should of just put my entire heart and soul into it so I could‚Äôt have it all, instead it makes me feel incomplete, guilty and bad and i feel like i always do wrong for the people around me, but what if i did the right thing and meant what i said and was able to‚Äôt the only one who loves me, someone who supports me despite being so negative at times, someone who understands my pain so deeply and unconditionally, someone who is there for me and listens to my every word...??????!! I feel like im a ghost and people keep taking pictures of me but i'm not them, I'm me.
====================
And now to present our games, i have to admit that while there's a bunch of smashers in Tekken, there are not a lot of games or folks in video games you can play it.   Pretty sad but also a bit frustrating
